I currently work in the Cloud Native Infrastructure team at ByteDance Inc. I am broadly working on serverlesslizatin of ByteDance's services. Before joining ByteDance, I worked with [Prof. Yue Cheng](https://tddg.github.io/) (now serving at UVA)  in [DS2 research lab](https://ds2-lab.github.io/) as a Ph.D. student at George Mason University. 

My research interests are serverless computing and generally cloud computing. Specifically, serverless computing breaks the traditional server-based monolithic application models into fine-grained functions and allows tenants to pay-per-use. My research explores the feasibility of using functions as an infrastructure to support stateful applications, e.g., data analytics tasks. A typical application of my research is to build serverless storage and serverless computing framework.

Before particiapting the Ph.D. program, I was a system architect that had over ten years of hands-on experience in system architecture and development.
