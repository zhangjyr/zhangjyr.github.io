I am a Ph.D. candidate in the [Computer Science Department](https://cs.gmu.edu/) at [George Mason University](https://www.gmu.edu/), where I work with [Dr. Yue Cheng](https://tddg.github.io/) in [DS2 research lab](https://ds2-lab.github.io/). 

Before particiapting the Ph.D. program, I was a system architect that had over ten years of hands-on experience in system architecture and development.

My research interests broadly include distributed systems and cloud computing. Specifically, I study the serverless computing that includes the infrastructures of function-as-a-service (FaaS) and its stateful applications. My current research focuses on providing in-memory object storage which is completely built and deployed atop ephemeral cloud functions. A typical application of my research is to accelerate data analytics workloads and machine learning trainings.
